The `filepath.Walk` function in Go is used to recursively traverse a directory tree. Hereâ€™s a breakdown of each part of the function call:

### `filepath.Walk(directory, func(path string, info os.FileInfo, err error) error { ... })`

- **`filepath.Walk(directory, ...)`**:
  - This is the function call to `filepath.Walk`. It takes two parameters:
    - `directory`: The root directory you want to start walking from. This can be a path to any directory on your filesystem.

- **`func(path string, info os.FileInfo, err error) error { ... }`**:
  - This is an anonymous function (also known as a lambda function) that is called for each file and directory visited during the walk. It has three parameters:
    - `path string`: The full path of the file or directory that has been visited.
    - `info os.FileInfo`: An `os.FileInfo` object containing information about the file or directory, such as its name, size, and permissions.
    - `err error`: An error encountered while traversing the file or directory. If there was no error, this will be `nil`.
